​	Today I learned about the importance of code review. I conducted the first code review of yesterday's assignment with two other team members. I have refactored the relevant code based on the feedback provided by my team members. I continued to learn the concept of TDD and did some related exercises.

​	This afternoon, through the Mars Rover case study, following the TDD approach, we will first write UT and then implement the method based on UT.

​	Through TDD learning, when refactoring the original code, it is important to ensure that the changes are small enough to ensure that the current functionality can still be used properly and all tests can pass correctly. The most impressive thing today was when the teacher made the refactoring, the granularity of the changes was very small. Although it may seem a bit troublesome, it ensures that the current function can still be used normally. After all, the premise of refactoring is to ensure that the code can run properly.

​	I have gained a lot from TDD and want to continue learning more about refactoring code to make it more elegant and beautiful.
